# House_Pricing_Prediction
In this House Price Prediction project, I'll work with machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These models will help us estimate house prices using a dataset that includes essential details such as house size, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the number of floors, heating and air conditioning availability, and parking options. The main aim is to build strong predictive models that can accurately figure out how much a house should cost. These models can be incredibly useful for real estate experts, people looking to buy a house, and those wanting to sell one. We'll use machine-learning techniques to uncover the hidden patterns and factors influencing house prices. Ultimately, this project will provide a data-driven approach to make better decisions in the ever-changing world of real estate.
